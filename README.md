What is it
==========

php-simple-request is a library designed to simplify requests validation and filtering, and generates an object from the request data.

The idea behind this library is to design objects that represent the requests the application receives, and use php-simple-request to map the request data to those objects. To do this, the library provides a set of annotations to specify the filters and validations to execute over the request data.
